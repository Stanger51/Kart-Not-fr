# Code of conduct

This program is made with the intention to help people make games. Many other similar projects aim to do the same thing, unfortunately, some are scams, some are behind expensive paywalls, and many just don't even work. I want to bring a free, reliable, and accessable tool to the community. A tool like this is the only way possible for someone to make a game with assets made by someone else. The only problem is if an asset is made by someone else it is unusable. Many first games from developers on this platform are inspired by other games. Even my first game was. I believe easy-access to a tool like this will help many other kids, teens, and adults get into making games on roblox without being blocked by unneccessary barriers.

This tool is intended for reuploading assets you have the legal right to transfer. Users are responsible for ensuring they have appropriate rights to all content. Transferring copyrighted content without permission is prohibited. The creator of this tool is not liable for any misuse or copyright infringement resulting from its use.

## Speak up

**This is a kids platform. [58% of users are below the age of 16. (Roblox 2023 Annual Report, p. 9)](https://s27.q4cdn.com/984876518/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/roblox-2024-proxy-and-2023-annual-report.pdf)**

**I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT TOLERATE REUPLOADING ASSETS RELATED TO ADULT CONTENT**

Many people in this community are disgusting. I do not tolerate many of the actions I have seen and heard about from people. What they are doing is beyond deplorable. They are directly allowing adults and children to interact with each other in an innapropriate setting.

**To people who are currently involved in these activities,**
>"It's better to admit that you walked through the wrong door than spend your life in the wrong room."

If you do know of people using this to upload adult content please do report it to me or my mods in the discord. As this is open-source I unfortunately cannot directly limit access to this. The only thing I can do is ban them and all their members from the discord and limit them from using the paid reuploader.

**Please actively speak out** against these individuals, even if you assume others will. Do not fall victim to the bystander effect. **Silence enables harm. Your voice matters.** Speaking out can:

- Raise awareness
- Empower others to speak against it
- Deters similar behavior
- Encourage others to self reflect

## Creating a positive community

Beyond that, there are constant stories about doxxing, people getting hacked, scams and more. Its not like we are doing crime guys, **we are making games on a kids platform.**

**Please help foster a positive environment and community.**

examples of helping create a positive environment are:

- Being welcoming and inclusive
- Being respectful
- Being honest
- Helping each other instead of calling each other skids

Most of us have one goal: to make a game. It does not have to be this bad. **Please do your best to help reform the terrible state of roblox culture on this side of the community. We need to break the cycle of harm.**
