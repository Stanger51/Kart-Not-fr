# Contributing

Thank you for being interested in contributing. I'm always trying to improve myself and whatever I put out. But, I'm just a 1 person team, so there is only so much I can do. I can always use the help from the community.

## Questions

If you have any questions join the [discord](https://discord.gg/XTEtUqPTat) or shoot me a DM, my tag is alekfart.

## Bug reports and suggestions

Reporting bugs and telling me how to make the reuploader better is also a big role in contributing. Community feedback means a lot, and I do TRY to listen to you guys. There is a dedicated suggestion channel in the discord so please suggest there. If you have a bug report then feel free to complain in general, DM me, or [create a new issue](https://github.com/kartFr/Asset-Reuploader/issues).

## Code

If you are thinking about contributing to the code, CONGRATULATIONS! You are probably a better coder than 99% of the people in the discord...

But really, code contributions are welcome and I'm always looking to improve my code and it's a great way for you to contribute to your community. So don't be afraid.
ALL forks are welcome!!

## Requirements

There are requirements when developing locally.

### Plugin

1. **[Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman)**, a tool chain manager.

Plugin is edited with **[PluginDebugService](https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/plugins)** on, so make sure to turn that on if you are planning to edit the plugin.

### Reuploader

1. **[Go](https://go.dev/)**

## Thank you

I'm only one guy. Contributions from the community is the only way this project has became this good. Everything major from code to minor like a bug report, I appreciate you all. Without contributors and support from the community this project would be nowhere near how it is now.
